These files contain examples of intentions, based on code from Marlin, with files prepared by PPMerge, viewed in MPS.
The files contain one or more cases where the intention is used. Such a case contains a code example, viewed from the three default projections.
The intention is then applied to one of the views, and the resulting model shown as outcome.
