## Structure
Each subdirectory represents a merge with conflicts from the Marlin mainline.
The directory is named after the merge commit sha.
Each directory contains a `README.md`, with links to the involved commits and pull requests for traceability,
along with three directories: `base`, `remote`, and `result`.
These three directories contain the state of all files that had conflicts, in those commits.

## Where do these come from?
