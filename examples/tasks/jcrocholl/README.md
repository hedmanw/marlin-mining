- Merging fork [jcrocholl/Marlin#c295a14b2822bf3882730fd5816628221187c287](https://github.com/jcrocholl/Marlin/commit/c295a14b2822bf3882730fd5816628221187c287)
- into mainline [MarlinFirmware/Marlin#5f555140be4231fb3ffea8a407414e245cfc12ec](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/commit/5f555140be4231fb3ffea8a407414e245cfc12ec)

## Task
The task is to merge the `fork` files into the `mainline` files.
The task contains one file to merge: `Marlin_main.cpp`.
The general rule is to accept `fork` changes as evolution, and to accept `mainline` changes that are not in the `fork`.
